# Project Co-Pilot: Real-Time AI Meeting Assistant

## Core Concept
Project Co-Pilot is an innovative AI-powered assistant designed to operate in real-time during meetings. Its primary functions are:
- Continuous, running summary of the conversation
- Proactive suggestions on relevant talking points
- Comprehensive final summary at meeting conclusion

The UI is a non-intrusive, transparent overlay that works above any website or web-based meeting platform, providing cognitive augmentation rather than just passive note-taking.

## Goals
- Enhance user focus, preparedness, and effectiveness during live discussions
- Deliver real-time, actionable insights and suggestions
- Ensure a seamless, private, and user-centric experience

## Scope
- Chrome extension for audio capture and overlay UI
- Real-time backend (Python/FastAPI) for STT and LLM integration
- Support for free/open-source and free-tier APIs for all core AI functions
- Initial focus on Google Meet, with extensibility for other platforms
- Prioritize privacy, low-latency, and intuitive UX
