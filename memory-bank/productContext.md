# Product Context

## Why Project Co-Pilot Exists
The rise of remote and hybrid work has led to an explosion of virtual meetings, increasing cognitive load for participants. Most tools focus on post-meeting analysis, leaving a gap for real-time, in-meeting cognitive support.

## Problems Solved
- Overwhelm from fast-paced, information-dense meetings
- Difficulty synthesizing and contributing in real time
- Lack of private, non-intrusive AI support during meetings

## User Experience Goals
- Provide real-time, glanceable summaries and actionable suggestions
- Maintain a transparent, non-distracting overlay UI
- Ensure privacy and user control at all times
- Seamlessly integrate into existing workflows without requiring bots or intrusive participants
